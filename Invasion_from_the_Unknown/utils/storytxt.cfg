Special care you must have about the boss scenarios, so try to keep as many high-level units alive as possible for avoiding nasty surprises. Although not strictly a requirement, I recommend players to have played or read the storyline behind Descent into Darkness and Under the Burning Suns, to be familiar with some characters and historical events."
