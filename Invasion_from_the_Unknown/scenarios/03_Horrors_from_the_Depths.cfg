		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Stupid girl! I am a lich, but I still have my own will, unlike my minions, which don't. I still feel, and I am aware of the current situation of Wesnoth.")}

		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "The name that used to be the name of what we call the lands at the south of the Swamps of Dread, West from the Silver Lands.")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Aye, and I guess my thirst for orcish death will never be satisfied. For I cannot go to the surface now that the land is under the control of the forces of Evil.")}
		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "What?")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Your kind always punished necromancy for being, supposedly, the greatest evil that could be done to the dead. However, you were wrong. I have seen things that even I consider abominations. For all these centuries, after the Fall, I have been hiding here, but I send minions to the outer world from time to time, to collect news from there.")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Some centuries ago, an evil shadow coming from the vast Ocean covered the lands, and an evil presence started to swallow every living creature. I did not know what it was, initially, but after some time, monstrosities from the underworld started to raid and destroy what human, elvish or orcish encampments were left in the desert. They were called, in my time, demons. I suppose you remember them, do you?")}
		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "We do, but it is not possible! The demon lord was vanquished by Eloh a long time ago!")}
		{MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "What are you talking about?")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "That was only the beginning of our doom. My theory is that something or someone opened a portal to the very heart of Hell, unleashing the forces of Evil and allowing them to enter our world. The only people I can blame, for their horrendous experiments, would be the Wesnothian magi. Their arrogance only led them, and therefore, all of us, to this chaotic future.")}
		{MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "So that is what attacked us in our valley...")}
		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "We need to escape from these caves, but then, we'll have to face the evil that roams above us, right now. What could we do?")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "You would get killed, tortured or converted by them in matter of hours. You are at a numeric disadvantage, nor do you have the powers necessary to fight against the demons.")}
		{MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "But you do, don't you?")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Nah, I'm not so sure. A long time has passed since the last time I fought anything myself, but I'm not afraid of dying. After all, I have nothing left except my old bones.")}

		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "I agree, but our kin tried before, and were unsuccessful. We have nothing to help us they did not have. It was a miracle for them that Eloh appeared on the earth to vanquish the evil. That won't happen again.")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "You would only need the power of the Union.")}
		{MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "What?")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Your highest priestesses know very well that it wasn't your goddess herself the one who saved you from that evil, but the power of the Union, at hands of the Master of Darkness and the Lady of Light.")}
		{MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "No!")}
		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "He's right, Galas. That is part of the truth we did not want our people to find out, so we kept it secret for centuries.")}
		{MSG_UNIT Galas ( _ "But then, how are we so sure that Eloh does exist?")}
		{MSG_UNIT Analia ( _ "Because of our faith. It's too late to judge our beliefs. Although Eloh herself did not vanquish this demon lord, she did send two warriors for that purpose. The proof is that they came from nowhere and went to nowhere.")}
		{MSG_UNIT (Mal Keshar) ( _ "Actually, they went to a place, a place very deep in the heart of the world. I felt their presences descending into the depths. However, one of them, the Master of Darkness, really disappeared from this world it seems, for I lost track of him. The Lady of Light seems to remain in this world, in that place, just sleeping. If you could awaken her, you would have half the power possibly necessary to defeat whoever is the master mind of this cruel plot.")}
