The other one, this Shadow Master, appeared mysteriously. And if he got possessed by an evil force in the very depths of the world, an evil force of darkness, and it turned him against the world? I can understand why you did not get affected by the corruption of such parts, Elynia, and it is yourself; your own internal light protects you as you did with Galas. But the Shadow Master would be himself part of the darkness, very prone to be corrupted.")}
