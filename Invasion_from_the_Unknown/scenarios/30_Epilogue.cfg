# EASTER EGGS AND OTHER ODDITIS
#
#Scenario 3:
#- If you capture the village at (24,39), inaccessible except by getting a bat to enlighten your way, you will get a message from a forum sith, and you'll ultimately lose the scenario.
#
#Scenario 4:
#- There is plenty of room here for more stuff...
#
#Scenario 5:
#- If you are merciful and spare Murlin's life, you will get a nice power-up item and a bonus dialogue somewhere in Episode 4.
#
#Scenario 7:
#- If you move an unit to (35,8), a touchplate will trigger revealing a hidden sideway that leads to an armor cloth that grants the bearer superb resistance to physical and fire damage!
#- (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) If you move an unit to (??,??), a secret sideway will be revealed, leading to a staff that has a powerful thunderbolt attack!
#
#Scenario 8:
#- There is a poison bow somewhere, very well hidden. Also, don't get too close to chasms or the floor will break and fall off to the depths.
#
#Scenario 10:
#- (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) If you let Mal Keshar rest for 3 turns he'll tell you the location of each glyphs!
#
#Scenario 22:
#- (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) There is stuff in a hidden room that will allow Elynia to summon slimers!
#- (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) There is a magic amulet in a hidden room that will reflect hits ("missed" ones) to inflict 50% of the effective strike damage on your oponent
#
#Scenario 23:
#- There is a bonus dialogue (see scenario 5 info)
#- (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) The enemy forces are seriously weakened in scenario 24 if you defeat all enemies in this one
#
#Scenario 24:
#- (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) If you defeat all enemies you will be transported to a secret scenario (Robotics) before scenario 25
#
#Scenario 26:
#- 
#
# No particular scenario:
# - The Shaxthal Drones were designed by using a copyrighted source as base/reference, but yet the differences are too many in my opinion to make for a law infringement. And yet, that design is very common in other sources
# - There's a left-over Tux unit. It was originally a combat unit, rather than an easter egg, for a campaign that I started some years ago but never finished or published
# - The original Shadow Master unit was less scary and more human / undead
# - The biomechanical Shaxthals concept is one of my ideas for the future of Earth
# - Elynia was intended to be able to "glamour" into other units, taking their appearance and stats, except for HP, but that was dropped during development because it would have made some issues too notorious
# - The music that inspired most of the later scenarios was The City Falls by Doug Kaufman
# - Elynia was originally intended to have been depicted with less clothes in scenario 10
# - Analia's name was a desperate attempt at "unoriginality". Actually I took the name from the core's name list for the Markov name generator.
# - Argan was going to be named "Ignatius" originally
# - Elynia was going to be named "Elda" originally
# - Galas was going to be a mature elven leader, originally
# - I pestered many developers with bugs related to the campaign's development
# - Elynia has a portrait that I drew when I was only 16 years old. You can imagine then why I did not publish it ;)
# - The campaign was to be named "Armageddon", but the idea was droped as there is at least one movie with that name inside
# - The campaign's length was inspired by A New Order, a campaign that I love but I didn't play again for that reason ;)
# - I worked until 3:00 AM in one oportunity debugging a scenario
# - Galas and Elynia did not have sex in scenario 19's (20's?) intro, actually.
# - Kritan was intended to be a small boy that was made the most loyal servant to the Shadow Master; however, he was dropped for storyline purposes
# - Shadow Master's maximum HP is 315; this is the IQ of Mortimer McMire in the Commander Keen series
# -
